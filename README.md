## Getting the blog up and running

This blog is using Jekyll one of the most popular static site generation tools.  To understand the broad strokes of Jekyll watch [Colin's Talk on Jekyll](http://community.thefirehoseproject.com/2015/07/16/colin-rubbert-talks-about-jekyll.html).

In addition to standard Jekyll configuration you will need to have Grunt installed as well.  This requires NPM to be installed, which requires NodeJS to be installed.

This is based off [this](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) theme.
