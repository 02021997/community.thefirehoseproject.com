## Background on Mikaila

Mikaila is a current student in the Firehose Project curriculum and works at an edtech startup called Gradeable on all aspects of the product. She started at Gradeable as the designer, and then taught herself HTML, CSS, and a smudge of Javascript, because there was work to be done.

Mikaila walks you through the process she used to understand her company's code before she understood code, and why collaborating with other developers will make you a much stronger developer than trying to go it alone.
